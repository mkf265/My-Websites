Once again, I was intrigued.&nbsp; <em>On The Table</em> initiative is about having people host open and honest conversations about mental health and addiction in effort to <em>#BreakTheSilence</em> and eliminate the stigma around mental illness and addiction that still greatly exists.&nbsp;</p><p>As a counselor, I regularly encourage my clients to use their voice whether it is to share, increase vulnerability or intimacy, honor or advocate for oneself, and to work through the shame that often plagues people with mental illness and addiction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The focus of psychotherapy with my clients typically entails understanding and resolving challenges with one’s intrapsychic and interpersonal relationships (represented by inner concentric circles, <em>hence the name Concentric</em>) versus the larger, social systems (outer concentric circles).&nbsp; Participating and joining forces with other hosts to help end the stigma associated with mental health and addiction while giving people an opportunity to use their voice fit Concentric’s mission with helping others to your their voice – but this time on a macro level.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On May 16, 2017, the therapists at Concentric Counseling &amp; Consulting hosted its first <em>On The Table</em> <em>2017</em> conversation in Millennium Park, across the street from our office.&nbsp; It was an unseasonably warm and windy day, and our topic was <strong>"</strong><strong>Your Voice Matters: Mental Health and Addiction. &nbsp;Honest Discussion About Why More People Don't Seek Out Help."&nbsp; </strong></p>

<p>We had an incredibly diverse group of people who actively participated.&nbsp; It was such an honor to hear people’s stories and ideas about why more people don’t seek out help.&nbsp; So many stories and barriers were shared.&nbsp; Common themes emerged and were extracted. &nbsp;Follows are some of the common themes people described that either prevented them or others they know from seeking services:</p><ul><li>Stigma, embarrassment, and shame.&nbsp; Seeking help is seen as a weakness.&nbsp; What will my family and friends <em>really</em> think about me?&nbsp; Will I be seen as a ‘nutcase?’ Denial about having a problem or my ego getting in the way.</li><li>Financial burden and obligations. Lacking financial resources all together. &nbsp;Treatment is a privilege for only those who can afford it. Lack or poor insurance coverage. All of the convoluted layers to insurance coverage.</li><li>Lack of information and available resources on how and where to find mental health and addiction services. &nbsp;Example given was local university offered free counseling services to its students but was not aware of services until his senior year of college. Not knowing how to access services or where to start. Location and other barriers to gaining access to solid services.</li><li>Cultural barriers and roadblocks, including families of certain cultures not supportive of mental health services. Experience with providers who lack cultural, gender identity, and sexual orientation competence. Religious barriers and lack of supports within religious communities.</li></ul><p>It is a reminder to all of that us that suffering from mental illness and/or addition is hard in of itself, not to mention having to endure additional barriers that get in the way of seeking and accessing help. &nbsp;Some of the solutions shared were not only to address or remove the aforementioned barriers and roadblocks, but to focus on the equity of mental and physical health.&nbsp;</p><p>People remarked how it is much easier and more acceptable to talk about their physical ailments, but not their mental health.&nbsp; Let’s look at people wholistically and give the mental health side the same due attention and respect.&nbsp; Another solution shared was to target childhood prevention.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the guests remarked in early childhood, we learn the importance of daily hygiene, such as brushing our teeth daily.&nbsp; Why not introduce conversation around mental health care at an early age or make mental health education mandatory in schools.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, when providing education on mental illness and addiction, don’t use extreme or scare tactics, such as the “This is Your Brain” drug campaign did in the 1980s.&nbsp; Guests remarked it only silences people more. Instead, provide a spectrum of information that can resonate with or speak to a variety of people across all ages and cultures.</p><p>My hope is that the information shared from our diverse group in Chicago can continue to be shared with others. And importantly,&nbsp;inspire all of us to participate in more active conversations about mental health and addiction whether it’s in your home, at work,&nbsp;in your community or as an <em>On The Table</em> host. &nbsp;Because Your Voice Does Matter!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> </p>]]></description></item><item><title>Is All Drug Use Created Equal?</title><category>Addictions</category><category>Communities</category><category>Families</category><category>Social Media</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Larson</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2017 02:08:57 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.concentricchicago.com/blog/2017/6/18/is-all-drug-use-created-equal</link><guid isPermaLink="false">560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402:563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875:5946d94259cc680257247e9f</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><em>By Concentric Counselor Myron Nelson, LCPC &nbsp; &nbsp;Edited by Concentric Counselor Jennifer Larson, LCPC, NCC</em></p><p>All drug use is not created equal. &nbsp;Take a look at that statement again and see if it contradicts or confirms your views on substance use. &nbsp;I hope by the end of this post you feel it does both. &nbsp;As a country, we are simultaneously experiencing an opioid heroin epidemic and progression in the legalization of marijuana. Clearly, drug use is not so black and white. &nbsp;I aim to gray the edges and disrupt some of your beliefs because critical thinking is needed in these cacophonous times. &nbsp;</p><p>We often tell kids to beware the slippery slope of drugs. &nbsp;As if smoking marijuana is a banana peel slide away from cocaine or criminal behavior. &nbsp;Not only does that argument neglect to account for alcohol (being many adolescents first introduction into mind-altering substances), but it also purports that all drug use is inherently related or equal. &nbsp;To say that one drug can lead to the use of another may be true, but that is because things kept hidden away in the dark tend to be hidden together. &nbsp;Research debating the effects of the slippery slope can teeter in either side's favor but both sides would agree that every individual person's path does not neatly align one way or the other. &nbsp;That point should not be ignored. &nbsp;</p><p>If you are concerned about someone's drug use, talk with him or her about it. &nbsp;There may be underlying mental illness issues or some form of trauma that is being treated by the effects of substances. &nbsp;Many will turn to substances to self-medicate symptoms of mental illness, neglect or trauma. &nbsp;Additionally, experimenting with drug use can be a normative behavior for certain subgroups. &nbsp;That does not mean it is safe or healthy, but it also does not mean its intent is malicious.</p><p>When you talk with someone about their behavior, be sure to not talk at them. &nbsp;Be mindful that attacking or judging their behavior typically is not going to lead to a productive conversation. &nbsp;Come to them seeking to fully understand them and what is going on. &nbsp;Coming down with an iron first also spreads the message that substance use is only dangerous. &nbsp;To pretend that substances or drugs do not produce a euphoric or calming effect creates misconceptions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If I were to cite research and share stories about the detriments of TV and forbade you from ever watching it, what might happen if you finally caught a glimpse of some TV show? &nbsp;You might find it enjoyable and then seek out other people who like to watch it too.&nbsp; You may then find yourself containing this information for fear of being criticized by others. &nbsp;So it becomes one of your secrets. &nbsp;Likewise, what if all you heard about alcohol was that it causes hangovers? &nbsp;</p><p>If you inform people about the benefits and consequences of substance use then they can start to formulate the foundation of decision-making and choices. &nbsp;If you think it is too dangerous to expose them to that knowledge, you may need to think again.&nbsp; You cannot stop it as images and scenarios of people enjoying being high on some kind of substance are constant in the media. &nbsp;Plus, putting up walls of censorship in the Internet era can be futile with certain people. &nbsp;You do not have to fight a battle against people discovering drugs can have positive effects; you can incorporate that as part of your conversations. &nbsp;Conversations with a 's' -- it is plural for a reason. &nbsp;No topic as big as substance use is going to be covered in one sit down.</p><p>Given what I've written so far you may imagine that I am an advocate in a way that I am not. &nbsp;When it comes to most substances and drugs, I take a firm stance that substance dependence is unsafe with detrimental consequences. &nbsp;I do not think someone's only way to relax after a long day at work should be to drink a beer and I do not think someone who is constantly depressed should seek to escape with substances, such as ecstasy. &nbsp;How someone is using should be discussed as well as what they are using. &nbsp;Certain drugs are more associated with images of horror or suffering, sometimes rightfully so, but do not let the name fool you. &nbsp;</p><p>This blog post is one part informative, two parts inquiry. &nbsp;It is a questioning of the commonplace idea that we have to draw deep lines in the sand about what drugs are not okay and when. &nbsp;We would all benefit from looking at all use in more detail. &nbsp;Parting words -- Experimentation is not addiction. Information is not dangerous (<em>taking into account age and other factors</em>).&nbsp; Open up the conversation and have many of them. &nbsp;Seek professional help if you believe you or a loved one struggles with substance abuse or dependence.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Moms -- You Hold the Key to Your Daughter's Healthy Body Image</title><category>Families</category><category>Young Children</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Larson</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 01:18:55 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.concentricchicago.com/blog/2017/4/20/moms-youre-the-key-to-your-daughters-positive-body-image</link><guid isPermaLink="false">560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402:563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875:58f9592aebbd1a8dd1483d17</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><em>By Concentric Counselor Michelle Taufmann, LCSW</em></p><p>Excerpt from Neighborhood Parents Network (NPN) blog: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npnparents.org/posts/1314,moms-you-re-the-key-to-your-daughters-positive-body-image">Moms, You're The Key To Your Daughters' Positive Body Image</a></p><p>How do we equip girls with a positive body image?&nbsp;It’s a never-ending question that doesn’t seem to wane no matter the advances of women in society.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/girls-women-and-wellness/201506/moms-what-will-your-body-image-legacy-be">Articles in the press</a>&nbsp;in recent years suggest that mothers are the most influential when it comes to girls’ attitudes toward their bodies.&nbsp;While societal messages, stereotypes and peers are influential forces,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/23/moms-daughters-influence-body-image/2690921/">mothers are their daughters' primary teacher</a>&nbsp;when it comes to beliefs toward body and physical mage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do mothers influence their daughters’ body image a healthy way? Focus your attention on the function and <em>ability</em>&nbsp;of body. When mothers appreciate their own and their daughters’ bodies for what they are capable of— resilience, flexibility, strength, and endurance —they help their daughters develop a positive perspective on their bodies. This one may be obvious, but is worth saying for those who have any doubts: Do not make negative comments or claims about your daughter’s body (e.g., “Wow, you sure got my thick ankles, didn’t you?"). It’s even best to keep favorable comments about your daughter's image to a minimum in effort to prevent over-identification with the body. Another “no-no” is supporting your daughter to diet or “watch her weight” (unless it’s medically necessary). Even if dieting is <em>her</em>&nbsp;idea or because her friends are doing it. &nbsp;Discourage it and take some time to have a healthy discussion about it.</p><p>Want to know more about how to be how you can help your daugther have a positive body image? &nbsp;The entire blog can be found by clicking <a target="_blank" href="http://The entire blog can be found by clicking here.">here</a>.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>How To Talk to Your Child About Sexuality and Gender Identity</title><category>Young Children</category><category>Families</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Larson</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2017 15:00:40 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.concentricchicago.com/blog/2017/3/9/how-to-normalize-your-childs-sexuality-and-gender-identity</link><guid isPermaLink="false">560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402:563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875:58c16884725e25f24c0c6157</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><em>By Concentric Counselor Myron Nelson, LCPC</em></p><p>Excerpt from Neighborhood Parents Network (NPN) blog: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npnparents.org/posts/1301,is-your-child-questioning-sexuality-or-gender-npnparents-org">Is Your Child Questioning Sexuality or Gender?</a>&nbsp;</p><p>You have noticed that your child is becoming attracted to a child of the same sex or is engaging in cross-dressing. &nbsp;Possibly your child is asking you questions about your own gender or sexual orientation. &nbsp;You're probably wondering,&nbsp;<em>Is this just a phase?</em>&nbsp;Buckle up, because it’s not simple.</p><p>The answer is yes and no. Some children have a clear sense whether they’re lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer (LGBTQ) from an early age and it never changes,&nbsp;while others might question and experiment with those identities only for a period of time.

I want to share some helpful and practical ways for you to improve young boys’ emotional IQ.</p><p>The best kind of care is preventative. &nbsp;A good starting point is helping boys explore emotions by starting with what they know. Look to the people they interact with regularly —in person or in fantasy—as a way to talk about emotions and feelings. Bring up emotions in their space and domain. Books, video games, and movies are all driven by character interactions and are full of openings to begin conversing about feelings, especially if there is a mismatch and incongruency between what someone is saying and what someone is doing.</p>

<p>If boys mention that someone was angry or nervous, you could ask, “How did you know?” Inquire about what cues they observed: Was it their body language? &nbsp;Facial expression? Words they verbalized? &nbsp;It can often feel safer to talk about other people’s experiences and emotions instead of ourselves.</p><p>To read the full blog, please go to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npnparents.org/posts/1295,help-your-boy-express-all-of-his-emotions-npnparents-org">Help Your Boy Express All of His Emotions</a> post.</p><p> </p>]]></description></item><item><title>Parenting Advice in 4 Words: Be Calm, Be Present</title><dc:creator>Jennifer Larson</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 16:29:39 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.concentricchicago.com/blog/2017/1/15/parenting-advice-in-4-words</link><guid isPermaLink="false">560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402:563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875:587b9d1a9f745611b9fe4035</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><em>By Concentric Counselor Michelle Taufmann, LCSW</em></p><p>Excerpt from Neighborhood Parents Network (NPN) blog: &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.npnparents.org/posts/1285,the-only-parenting-advice-you-need-in-4-words-npnparents-org">"The Only Parenting Advise You Need in 4 Words" &nbsp;</a></p><p>Over a dozen years of parenting and dozens of books on parenting later, my advice to parents out there is:&nbsp;Forget about it.&nbsp;</p><p>We are bombarded by so much advice, it is difficult to retrieve “to do's” from our cluttered memory banks especially when faced with parenting challenges. We absorb on a daily basis a litany of advise —advice on how to get fit, how to save for retirement,&nbsp;what to put in our bodies, how to keep our homes maintained, how to manage office politics, etc.&nbsp; It’s advice overload. And if the adage “keep it simple” applies to anything in our lives,&nbsp;it’s parenting.</p>

Please know this blog just scratches the surface as there are many facets when it comes to boundaries and communication, but at least these pointers can be the launching pad you need to start.&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>People consistently ask how to bring up an important or sensitive topic to a person while at the same time not hurting their feelings, making the situation worse, or coming off as a jerk.&nbsp; While we cannot ultimately control the outcome of the interaction or the other person’s feelings, we most certainly can prepare and use an approach that can increase the chances of a better outcome keeping in mind integrity, respect, and boundaries.&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>For some, it takes a lot of courage and strength to confront a person. So, if this is you, give yourself a pat on the back for taking this difficult step.&nbsp; Some people may feel somewhat comfortable or even enjoy confronting, but may neglect to do it somewhat well.&nbsp; Whatever your situation is, just remember it may be awkward to learn something new, it’s okay to make mistakes along the way.&nbsp; You will get better with further learning and practice.&nbsp; As we therapists love to say, “It’s a process.”&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>One of the first things to consider is what is your intention (or goal) for bringing up an important topic to another.&nbsp; Is it to clarify a situation, better understand another, ask someone if they can meet a need of yours, or come up with a solution?&nbsp; For purposes of having this conversation, try to clearly define your intention(s) coming up with only one or two.&nbsp; If there are more areas to cover with this person, you can parcel out over time with several conversations.&nbsp; But for this initial conversation, you don’t want to fire off a litany of items all at once.&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>Ok, so you now have your 1-2 intentions.&nbsp; Next, you will want to ‘invite’ the person to have a conversation with you.&nbsp; You do not want to spring it on this person when he or she least expects it.&nbsp; You want to be mindful of not only when you are available to provide your <em>full </em>attention, but also when the other person is completely available.&nbsp; The invite can be, “I would like to talk to you about something that is really important to me, are you around to chat tonight over dinner or tomorrow morning?”&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>The day, time and possibly place have been pinned down.&nbsp; Next is the anticipation of actually having the conversation.&nbsp; You may be fraught with anxiety, fear, or other unpleasant feelings.&nbsp; If this is the case, it’s perfectly normal and okay.&nbsp; Keep in mind, the other person may be just anxious.&nbsp; Just remember this person and topic are important to you, and you are approaching this person with your best intentions and method of communication.&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>The time has come to engage with one another.&nbsp; You can warm up the interaction by either acknowledging or thanking the person for being open to talking or you can briefly state something that is positive about that person or the two of you.&nbsp; This warm-up can help ease both of you into the conversation while setting a positive (or even neutral) tone. </span></p><p><span>After easing in, you will share your thoughts and feelings by speaking from an “I” position versus opening the dialogue with “You.”&nbsp; Speaking from an “I” position shows accountability and ownership whereas entering the conversation with “You” can put the person on the defense.&nbsp; For instance, “I have been bothered lately by the lack of connection or sex between us”, “I have concerns about our how you address disciplining our child and want to learn more about your position on this”,&nbsp;“I am feeling overwhelmed and would like some support from you with the household chores" or "I would like to talk about the restaurant incident the other day.”&nbsp; Remember you are the one who ultimately wants this conversation, so it is up to you to share <em>you</em> (your thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and beliefs).&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>Try your best not to blame the other person, be critical or judgmental, talking down to the person or going into demands and commands.&nbsp; Also, try your best to suspend those pesky loaded terms, such as “always”, “never” or “should." &nbsp;Use these words judiciously as they often do not depict complete accuracy (e.g. You never compliment me; You are always rude) not to mention these words can convey judgment and criticism (You should want to be a better partner to me; You should know what I want).&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>Also, be mindful of your tone, choice of words, body language, including facial expressions.&nbsp; Eye-rolling, using offensive language, speaking in a patronizing tone or yelling, sitting with your arm crossed are some examples that will undermine the conversation.&nbsp; You want to work towards conveying both verbally and non-verbally openness, equity, and respect.&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>So, you’ve shared your thoughts keeping these key items in mind, now what?&nbsp; Depending on the topic or person, the conversation can go in a variety of directions.&nbsp; For brevity sake, let’s say worse-case scenario is this person reacts negatively to you.&nbsp; Depending on the type of negativity, you may need to remove yourself from the conversation, pause the conversation until both of you are in a better spot to chat constructively or you can redirect the interaction by expressing your overall intention and that you would like to reciprocate by also fully listening and understanding the other person.&nbsp; You can ask for a commitment that both of you will try your best. &nbsp;It’s okay if the two of you may not agree or feel the same way.&nbsp; For you, you are learning how to bring up an important topic to another with a few tools in your bag. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Go ahead, and give it whirl -- you're on your way to learning how to approach people with topics that matter to you!&nbsp;

Many parents generally tend to get squeamish, anxious or shy away from bringing up this very important topic with their children.&nbsp; Ideally, it’s best to start in early childhood, but it’s never too late to start.&nbsp; In this blog, we will focus on children ages 0-7.&nbsp; Yes, infancy because we are constantly talking in front of them, infants explore their bodies, and we start to form bonds and attachment during this period.&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>Ideally, you will want to have several conversations – talking <em>and</em> listening - about sex with your child as he or she develops and ages.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Before we share some guidelines, it is worth noting sex has various connotations and meanings.&nbsp; Sex can be used to describe the biological markers of gender or it can fall on a spectrum to include one’s biological, genetic markers, internal and external sex organs, and hormones.&nbsp; Sex can incorporate one’s gender identity, sexual identity and sexual orientation as well as sex can describe the various activities that involve a person (or persons) with or without their genitals.&nbsp; And, we can think of sex when considering procreation.&nbsp; Given there is not a universal or one size fits all definition of sex, it important to consider the various meanings and definitions of sex when engaging in discussions with your children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>Here are some guidelines to think about when discussing sex with your child who ranges between 0-7 years-old. &nbsp;Naturally, you will want to be </span>mindful of your child's biological <em>and</em> developmental age.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Body and Body Parts.</strong>&nbsp; You can explain that people’s bodies come in different shapes, sizes and color, and over time, our bodies change.&nbsp; Boys’ and girls’ bodies and interests can be similar and different.&nbsp; Each person’s body belongs to that person, and it’s important to be mindful of people’s physical boundaries.&nbsp; Some like to use the visual example of pretend you are wearing a swimsuit.&nbsp; The swimsuit covers the most private parts of your body. Normalize to your child that it’s normal to be curious and touch all of your body parts.&nbsp; It’s okay if your toddler has cute names for their private parts, but as they get older, you want to encourage them to use correct words for body parts, such as penis and vagina.</span></p><p><span><strong>Conception, Birth and Delivery.</strong>&nbsp; You can start by sharing that all living things reproduce, such as plants and animals. There are different ways to conceive or make a baby. &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.parenting.com/article/talking-to-kids-about-sex-21335549">Parenting.com <em>Talking to Kids About Sex</em> </a>suggests these explanations: &nbsp;"When the penis and the vagina fit together, sperm, like tadpoles, swim through and out of the penis into a vagina to find an egg which gets fertilized.&nbsp; The fertilized egg turns into a growing baby.&nbsp; Mom has a uterus inside her tummy, where you lived until you were big enough to be born.&nbsp; When you were ready to be born, the uterus pushed you out through Mommy's vagina."</span></p><p><span><strong>Closeness, Touch, and Intimacy.</strong>&nbsp; It’s okay to allow or at times encourage our child to give grandma or uncle a hug good-bye, but if your child is displaying resistance, no need to force the issue. You can ask your child what feels comfortable for him or her or offer an alternative such as a high-five or fist-bump. &nbsp;You can explain sex or close affection can feel good and it's a way people express their affection and love for each other. &nbsp;When people feel safe and loved, people give each other permission to touch each other in ways they want to be touched, such as holding hands or kissing each other, which can make them close and loved.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p><span><strong>Sexual Health and Protection.</strong>&nbsp; When changing your baby's diaper, talk aloud about how you are going to clean your baby's bottom or bum. &nbsp;Starting at toddler age, explain some behaviors warrant privacy, such as when you touch your penis or vagina, choose a private place, such as your bedroom or bathroom. &nbsp;Educate and remind your child that Mom or Dad may touch your private body parts only when helping you get cleaned as you learn how to use the potty or use the bathroom.&nbsp; It is important to inform your child the importance of taking care of his or her body to maintain good hygiene and health, such as washing our breasts.&nbsp; A reminder that your doctor can only touch your vagina if you have pain or an infection in that area, but only when Mommy or Daddy are in the room with you.&nbsp; Teach your child the importance of when and how to say, “No” to unwanted touch and when to tell a trusted adult (e.g. teacher, parent)&nbsp;you have been touched when you didn’t want to be or when you said “No” and it was not respected.</span></p><p><span><strong>Freedom of Expression.</strong>&nbsp; You can tell your child that people share same and different interests, and this is okay and acceptable.&nbsp; You can encourage them to be free to express his or her interests and express themselves based on who they are.&nbsp; Sharing stories about your own relationships throughout your life can be helpful to hear, such as how some friendships remain the same while others have changed.&nbsp; The message is that over time, we will have different relationships or preferences with people as we grow and change. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The important thing to remember is engaging in conversations about sex will be an ongoing process throughout your child’s life.&nbsp; You may not have all the answers or get stumped by a question your child asks which is perfectly fine.&nbsp; If this happens, you can respond by saying, "Let me think about that or I’ll get back to you with an answer." The important idea to remember is how you carry yourself and come across.&nbsp; Displaying openness, willingness, and actively listening without responding with silliness or shaming is what matters most. &nbsp;All of the answers are within reach as there is plenty of information on the Internet, at your local library, and through your support systems.&nbsp; Pat yourself on the back for asking this important question,&nbsp;and enjoy your journey as you start talking about sex with your child!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Here a few resources to check out: </span></p><p><em><span>It's So Amazing!: A Book About Eggs, Sperm, Birth, Babies and Families by Robie H.

Your spouse's reluctance to communicate to you could stem from a variety of reasons, such as not feeling the same way about divorce as you or not ready to confront and deal with certain hardships that go with divorce. &nbsp;</p> 

  
    
    
      
        
          
            <img class="thumb-image" data-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402/t/572a7a5d1d07c0f63586288f/1462401744894/" data-image-dimensions="450x299" data-image-focal-point="0.5,0.5" data-load="false" data-image-id="572a7a5d1d07c0f63586288f" data-type="image" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402/t/572a7a5d1d07c0f63586288f/1462401744894/?format=1000w" />
          
        

        

      
    
    
  


<p>For instance, if you were the one who wanted and initiated the divorce, you may be more eager to get things moving along. &nbsp;It's possible your spouse may be still processing the divorce, feeling more connected and in touch with his/her feelings about the demise of the relationship (versus wanting to think about and start preparing and planning the divorce). &nbsp;Also, it could be your spouse's way of gaining control or making you sweat and stew if the decision was not mutual or if other events occurred in the marriage that may have led to divorcing (e.g. infidelity). &nbsp;Possibly your spouse has had a long-standing history of struggling with engaging in communication.</p><p>Your question is more related to "How Can I Get My Spouse to Engage...?&nbsp;&nbsp;Without knowing your and your spouse's details and how long this has been going on, I can give you some information to think about that I hope will be helpful. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>1. &nbsp;How is your approach when trying to engage your spouse? &nbsp;It is difficult for you to manage your emotions, thoughts, or behaviors with your spouse? &nbsp;Try to be mindful of these areas, such as paying attention to your tone, delivery, non-verbal behaviors, and choice of words you use. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>2. &nbsp;How realistic are you with your timeline? &nbsp;For instance, if the two of you just separated or if either one of you just expressed wanting a divorce, you may need to sit a little more and be patient with the next steps. &nbsp;Engaging in support of friends and those you trust (maybe a divorce support group) during the 'waiting' periods is important self-care. &nbsp;</p><p>3. &nbsp;It's important to convey on some level empathy, respect and mindfulness (as difficult as it may be to do). &nbsp;An example would be to express that you are mindful that s/he may not be feeling the same way or you recognize there are differences in how the both of you are approaching the divorce. &nbsp;</p><p>4. &nbsp;Share your position effectively with your spouse, such as I am ready and willing to discuss the legal parts of divorcing, and ask or invite your spouse to talk about this with you. &nbsp;You can ask when your spouse will be willing and ready to talk about starting the paperwork. &nbsp;Can the two of you agree to a time by meeting in the middle? &nbsp;</p><p>5. &nbsp;If you are engaging in these steps and your spouse is stonewalling you, you can offer professional assistance to help the both of you, such as speaking to a therapist, counselor, a divorce mediator. &nbsp;</p><p>6. &nbsp;If all of these steps have been exhausted, then your next best bet is to consult with a divorce and family law attorney about his/her ideas about how to handle communication, and the overall process and steps proceeding with a divorce. &nbsp;For some, it may be best for your and your spouse's attorneys to handle the communication versus you and your soon-to-be ex partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Again, going through a divorce is one of life's most difficult challenges with typically ups and downs for most people. &nbsp;Give yourself time and space to go through the process, and be sure to engage in good self-care during this time. &nbsp;Remember, we cannot make or demand a person to engage, but we can most certainly increase our chances of engagement by controlling and modifying our process and approach. &nbsp;</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Ask The Therapist?

Some typical symptoms for adults are:</span></p><p><strong><span>Disorganization</span></strong><span>:&nbsp; Someone diagnosed with ADHD may struggle with time management and staying on top of certain tasks.</span></p><p><strong><span>Forgetfulness</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;We can all be a bit forgetful at times; however, adult with ADHD forgetting routinely happens.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Lack of focus</span></strong><span>:&nbsp; Being easily distracted, difficulty listening to others in conversations and work settings, and overlooking details.</span></p><p><strong><span>Hyper-focus</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;&nbsp; On the flip side of ‘lack of focus’, there is hyper-focus. Sometimes a person with ADHD can be engrossed in an activity that is of interest to them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Poor listening skills</span></strong><span>: &nbsp;It is not uncommon to hear reports from their partner or family member that they have to repeat themselves often.&nbsp; </span></p><p><strong><span>Impulsivity</span></strong><span>:&nbsp; &nbsp;This means interrupting others, blurting out thoughts without thinking, and suffering from addictive tendencies.&nbsp;</span></p>

When a child uses coping tools and their brave behavior is praised, young children can learn to manage their anxiety and gain confidence.&nbsp; Sometimes parents become anxious when their child experiences anxiety that they think the best option is to become overprotective or to enable the child to avoid the very thing or situation that triggers anxiety.&nbsp; Avoidance can lead to fueling and increasing the anxiety. </span></p><p><span>The first step would be to tell your child what anxiety is, how it shows up in our thoughts, physical sensations, emotions, and behaviors, and that anxiety is normal to experience.&nbsp; You can help your child identify how he or she experiences worry physically in his or her body, such as some children feel butterflies in their stomach, their hands may get sweaty,&nbsp;or behaviorally as they may want to hide. If you as a parent have anxiety, you can share your anxiety which can be validating and normalizing for your child.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The next step would be to identify the type of anxiety (and its respective triggers) and to learn tools that can help your child reduce their anxiety.&nbsp; You can become educated by learning the many tools for helping your child learn how to manage his or her thoughts, physical sensations, emotions, and behaviors.&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>Filling up a toolbox of tools can be one of the most helpful ways to assist your child with anxiety issues. &nbsp;Examples of some coping tools could be coloring, squeezing a ball, deep breathing, engaging in positive thoughts, and coming up with comforting, visual imagery.&nbsp; You can encourage your child to ‘test’ those tools out and see which ones are more effective.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, encourage your child to come up with ideas that will help the anxiety.&nbsp; This ownership can instill confidence, a sense of responsibility, and hopefulness.&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>For more resources on childhood anxiety, check out:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.anxietybc.com/parenting/childhood-anxiety">http://www.anxietybc.com/parenting/childhood-anxiety</a>&nbsp; </span><span>h</span><span><a href="http://www.anxietybc.com/parenting/complete-home-tool-kit">ttp://www.anxietybc.com/parenting/complete-home-tool-kit</a></span></p><p><span>To learn more about our specific services, check out: &nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.concentricchicago.com/child-family-therapy/"><span>Child, Adolescent &amp; Family Therapy</span></a>&nbsp;AND <a href="http://www.concentricchicago.com/consulting-parents/"><span>Solution-Focused Services for Parents</span></a></p><p> </p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402/563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875/5702eeaa04426228e6ce4934/1464643789015/1500w/askthetherapist.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="320" height="114"><media:title type="plain">Ask the Therapist?

Do not make any immediate decisions regarding your marriage.</strong> &nbsp;You are experiencing one of life’s most devastating and traumatic events which flood you with emotional intensity overriding judgment and reasoning. &nbsp;Acting now may entail regrets later. &nbsp;Remember your relationship with your spouse and family has developed over time. &nbsp;Your marriage and children are one of your biggest life’s investments which warrant time to determine this important decision and its lifelong impact. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Experience your feelings and sit with your values.</strong> &nbsp;Experience your feelings as they arise. &nbsp; Take note of how your upbringing, values, or religious beliefs may play a role in figuring out what to do. &nbsp;Grab a journal and write it all out. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Talk with those you trust.</strong> &nbsp;You will want to obtain support from others. &nbsp;Select a few people you truly trust. &nbsp;Telling everyone can be very damaging by creating more confusion and chaos. &nbsp;Not to mention, if you and your spouse decide to stay together, some family and friends may not be able to recover and re-integrate into your family. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Begin a self-care program.</strong> &nbsp;Taking care of yourself is vital to your well-being during this time. &nbsp;Tune into the basics, such as a getting adequate sleep, eating a healthy, balanced diet, and exercising. &nbsp;You may want to shift your focus by picking up a hobby or enrolling in a fun class.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Remain committed to other areas of your life.</strong> &nbsp;Continue to be present by focusing on your children, going to work, and taking care of your household.</p><p><strong>6. Confront your spouse.</strong> Find the appropriate time and environment to ask your spouse general questions about the affair. &nbsp;Do not engage in ‘pain shopping’ by demanding nitty-gritty details that will only be more traumatic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7. Become educated.</strong> &nbsp;Read some books about infidelity and begin to understand the various contributing factors that can lead to infidelity. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>8. Get counseling and therapy.</strong> &nbsp;Meet with an individual therapist for guidance and support during this time especially given the risk of depression and anxiety. &nbsp;Seeking couples therapy will be important if the goals are to explore and understand the contributing factors to the infidelity; to repair, heal, and rebuild the marriage; or to transition to separation and divorce. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>9. Consult with a lawyer.</strong> &nbsp;You may want to obtain general information about your rights and the legal process.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>10. &nbsp;Do we tell our children?</strong> &nbsp;Infidelity does affect children. &nbsp;There is no hard and fast answer to this question. &nbsp;It depends on various factors, some include the type of infidelity, whether children know or are at risk of discovering, age of children, and whether parents remain together or divorce. &nbsp;A therapist can guide parents as to what to and what not to share based on these factors. &nbsp;</p><p>Experiencing unfaithfulness in marriage is one of the most crushing experiences a person can go through. &nbsp;Engaging in these steps will help you get through the pain in the best way possible with integrity. &nbsp;They can also help you gain greater insight and awareness into your marriage and determine the answer and the best course of action for you and your family.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402/563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875/56e96eb5f850829a3e2c3f87/1464644020106/1500w/Infidelity+%281%29.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="738" height="626"><media:title type="plain">Should I Stay or Should I Go?

<p>These macro-systems affect individuals and families on many levels, including compromised mental health and well-being. &nbsp;If you can relate and find these city and state-wide issues are real to you and impact your emotional and psychological well-being, you are most certainly not alone.&nbsp; Everyone deals and copes in different ways, such as being vocal and advocating for change, getting into decision-making mode with preparing and planning, or internalizing all of it finding a way to distract and escape from it.&nbsp;</p><p>I encourage you to acknowledge, emote, and talk about the impact of these larger systems on your life, but I also encourage you not to get completely engulfed and swept away in it.&nbsp; It’s not good for your mental health.&nbsp; There is an analogy in mindfulness which encourages people to step behind the waterfall and simply watch and acknowledge its presence and details, but not to jump into it which would lead to a tumultuous ride and possibly and ultimately, one’s demise.&nbsp; Conversely, do not turn your back to it and ignore or deny its reality.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you find that you are feeling the weight of our local news and politics, bringing you down or increasing &nbsp;your anxiety, take a moment to acknowledge, but then step back and shift your attention to something that restores you such as connecting with others, reading a book, connecting to your body with movement or getting into a creative space. &nbsp;After all, we cannot control all of the external happenings in our life, but we can control how we cope and respond. Hope you are able to carve out some 'self-care' time during these times.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> </p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402/563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875/56bd3abd22482eca1585b2a0/1464644192946/1500w/" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="300" height="66"><media:title type="plain">One Way Chicagoans' Mental Health May be Compromised</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Response to Johann Tari's TED Talk: What's Really Wrong Here</title><category>Addictions</category><category>Social Media</category><category>Communities</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Larson</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2016 16:05:57 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.concentricchicago.com/blog/2016/2/5/johann-tari-ted-talk-everything-you-think-you-know-about-addiction-is-wrong</link><guid isPermaLink="false">560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402:563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875:56b4c54e2b8ddeeb63aa4fd6</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><em>By Concentric Counselor Jennifer Larson, LCPC, NCC</em></p><p>Admittedly I do not carve enough time to watch or listen to TED talks.&nbsp; One of my clients referenced how she will listen to them particularly when she’s cooking dinner.&nbsp; My dinner routine typically entails listening to music in the background, catching glimpses of my son playing a game or doing his homework, or practicing mindfulness to be present when making dinner in effort to de-clutter my head space and take a reprieve from the perpetual tasks of multi-tasking.&nbsp;</p><p>Listening to a TED talk while cooking dinner never dawned on me, and I liked the idea.&nbsp; So, this past Monday I popped onto TED and scanned the topics.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_everything_you_think_you_know_about_addiction_is_wrong?language=en"><em>Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong</em></a> immediately piqued my interest.&nbsp;</p><p>It jumped out, well because various forms of addiction is all so familiar to me due to my childhood upbringing and how addiction permeated the fabric of my family’s life as well as I am a psychotherapist who helps people to heal and work through their own addictions.&nbsp; Plus, I was so curious to listen given the title was loaded with terms such as “<strong><em>EVERYTHING</em></strong>&nbsp;you think you know” and “about addiction is <em><strong>WRONG</strong></em>” that I wondered if this somehow applied to my personal experiences and professional knowledge of addictions.&nbsp; We cannot possible know everything, and I became curious to know if there is information that breaks through the past and current trends about addictions.&nbsp;</p><p>In his TED talk, Johann Tari, a British journalist, speaks about his own relationship to his family members who struggle with addiction, specifically substances.&nbsp; His thirst for wanting to have a better understanding of what contributes or causes addiction drove him to find the answers.&nbsp; His journey covers speaking with various people from all walks of life, spanning different cultures.</p>

<p>As I listen to his voyage, I am struck by his journey as he spoke with a street user and a Vancouver Professor of Psychology who conducted experiments with rats in isolation and within a community of rats called “Rat Park” to referencing the Vietnam War and Portuguese approach to decriminalizing drugs.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, Johann Tari argues it is a lack of human connections that contribute to and maintain addictions. &nbsp;Conversely, deeper, human individual and societal connections can allay (or treat if you will) addictions.&nbsp;</p><p>While I most certainly agree of the importance of human connections being vital to our biosocial-cognitive-psychological development, overall well-being, and yes, people who suffer from addictions,&nbsp;I have also come to recognize understanding the causes of and treating addictions is far more complex that just forming individual and societal human bonds.&nbsp; Also, I would like to add we know earlier childhood attachment and social connections play a significant role when understanding addiction, so <strong><em>everything</em></strong> we know about addiction is <strong><em>wrong</em></strong> isn’t entirely accurate.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s face it, humans and addictions are complex.&nbsp; We do not know everything there is to understand about the various forms of addictions spanning different social environments and cultures, but we do know quite a bit, and understanding the etiology and treatment of addiction goes beyond just forming human connections.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Without going into nitty-gritty details, there are many models of addiction.&nbsp; A few to highlight are the disease model of addiction which looks at the biology, neurobiology, and genetics of an individual as well as his or her social environment.&nbsp; Some understand addiction by assessing a person’s earlier childhood and developmental attachment with their caregivers, the inherent chemical properties or pharmacology of a substance, and social evolution of groups of people over time (e.g. socio-economic status).&nbsp; The public health model informs us to look at addiction by understanding the person and his or her vulnerability, the substance and its inherent properties, the vector (who brings the substance in and its incentives), and the social environment that allows and supports the use of substance.&nbsp; And, the bio-psych-social-spiritual (BPSS) model takes into account the interconnections and interplay of the biology, psychology, social, and spiritual aspects of a person.&nbsp;</p><p>What about process addictions where there is no substance or drug, and subsequently no inherent properties to even consider?&nbsp; Process addictions are an addiction to an activity or person, such as gambling, spending, Internet, or co-dependency. &nbsp;And, I have not even touched up treatment and recovery of addiction models which by the way vary depending on who you talk to, the substance or process, the various recovery approaches including 12-step models, and what best fits the individual person within his or her family and community systems.&nbsp;</p><p>So, what started off as a little diversion from my usual dinner preparation routine has prompted me to inform others that we do know a thing or two about addiction and it’s more than just forming human connections.&nbsp; Some of us may know inherently or through acumen that individual, family, and community connections are necessary and important for our survival, evolution, success, and even recovery, but please know understanding the causes and treatment of addiction go beyond human connections. &nbsp;<strong><em>Now, t<em><strong>h</strong></em>at is something we do know.&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.concentricchicago.com/blog/2016/2/5/johann-tari-ted-talk-everything-you-think-you-know-about-addiction-is-wrong">Permalink</a><p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402/563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875/56b4c54e2b8ddeeb63aa4fd6/1464644473881/1500w/" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="783" height="469"><media:title type="plain">Response to Johann Tari's TED Talk: What's Really Wrong Here</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Using Your Voice</title><category>Self-Care</category><category>Communities</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Larson</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 16:51:28 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.concentricchicago.com/blog/2016/1/15/using-your-voice</link><guid isPermaLink="false">560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402:563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875:5699220d1c121004ba22fdf0</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><em>By Concentric Counselor Jennifer Larson, LCPC, NCC</em></p><p>We believe in the importance of using your voice.&nbsp;

<p>In the recent months, we have heard many vocalize their needs and wants and subsequently --&nbsp;Call To Action --&nbsp;with the shooting of Laquan McDonald.&nbsp; And just a few days ago, Chicago Public School (CPS) high school students used their voice to express their needs in the <em>Are We Equal? – Chicago Public Schools</em> video: &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tYBf3WA6WI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tYBf3WA6WI</a></p><p>So, if you have been internalizing, containing your thoughts and feelings of late, we are giving you permission to honor yourself to be congruent and vocal.&nbsp; Whether you are struggling with a family member, your loved one, friend or a larger system, such as your community or school, we encourage you to use your voice to share or advocate.&nbsp; We just have one request: &nbsp;Express yourself in a meaningful way that is mindful and productive.&nbsp; Go ahead and give it a try.&nbsp; We believe in you.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402/563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875/5699220d1c121004ba22fdf0/1464644792360/1500w/" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="236" height="224"><media:title type="plain">Using Your Voice</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Post Thanksgiving, Keep the Gratitudes Coming</title><category>Communities</category><category>Self-Care</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Larson</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 29 Nov 2015 23:09:35 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.concentricchicago.com/blog/2015/11/29/post-thanksgiving-keep-the-gratitudes-coming</link><guid isPermaLink="false">560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402:563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875:565b84bfe4b0f60cdbba8371</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><em>By Jennifer Larson, LCPC, NCC</em></p><p>Most of us have just returned from spending the Thanksgiving holiday with family and friends who are far and near. The Thanksgiving holiday reminds us to reflect upon and express our gratitude to others as the Pilgrims did with the Native Americans over their 3-day feast.&nbsp; The Native Americans helped the Pilgrims to adapt to a different habitat and culture by teaching them the fundamental skills for survival and living.&nbsp; This type of relationship is analogous to other relationships, such as parents and children, teachers and students, mentors and mentees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many of the clients I work with are adept at maintaining their work calendar, their children's school and extracurricular activities, etc.&nbsp; And yet, usually these same individuals do not have a personal calendar and do not block off time for their personal needs and wants.&nbsp; I suspect one of the reasons is that most companies require their employees to use their system calendar.&nbsp; Many schools hand out calendars with posted events.&nbsp; Nowadays many schools require parents to login into a portal to view their child's classroom and school events.&nbsp; I suppose no-one really hands out or requires one to use a personal calendar.&nbsp; In the spirit of full disclosure, I typically do not tell people what to do, but I rather encourage and guide.&nbsp; Admittedly, I am passionate about self-care.&nbsp; So, I do highly encourage you (ahem, telling you) to begin to use a personal calendar in effort to transform your self-care regimen.&nbsp; You are worth it!</p><p>Want a little more information on how to transform your self-care?&nbsp; Here is a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.concentricchicago.com/s/NPNArticle.pdf">short article</a> I wrote earlier in the year which outlines 3 simple tips to transform your self-care.&nbsp; You deserve it!&nbsp;</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402/563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875/5640e58fe4b089d6ff94c54a/1464645264051/1500w/" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="250" height="322"><media:title type="plain">3 Tips to Transform Your Self-Care Regimen</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Connections Can Be Made</title><category>Social Media</category><category>Communities</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Larson</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2014 22:10:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.concentricchicago.com/blog/2015/11/9/connections-can-be-made</link><guid isPermaLink="false">560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402:563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875:564127dbe4b08472d6d7c535</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><em>By Jennifer Larson, LCPC, NCC</em></p><p>On July 29th, I wrote a blog, "<a href="http://www.concentricchicago.com/blog?tag=Connections">Can connecting with others through social media really work?</a>" &nbsp;I wrote this before Larson Counseling &amp; Consultation kicked off its first "Let's Talk" series via Facebook during a specified one hour LIVE time-frame later that evening.</p><p>My colleague and I logged on. &nbsp;The first 15 minutes were quiet -- quiet as a mouse. &nbsp;Those 15 minutes felt particularly long because we did not know if anyone was present on the other side. &nbsp;How would one really know when you are on Facebook? &nbsp;Sure, you can see folks that are online and logged in, but it doesn't give you any more information than that. &nbsp;It made me think that connecting with others via social media can be experienced -- or in our case during the first 15 minutes, not experienced.</p>

<p>When working with my clients, I have long touted the benefits of generating and identifying as many viable options (solutions or coping tools) as possible when facing challenges and obstacles in life. Why not I, as a therapist, consider as many options as possible when it comes to connecting and helping others?</p><p>Just minutes away, Ashley and I are taking the first attempt at connecting with others via Facebook by offering a Q&amp;A. It is the start of our "Let's Talk" 3-part series. Tonight, people can ask questions related to counseling and therapy. Examples, such as: Which issues warrant counseling? &nbsp;What is the difference between individual, couples, child, and family therapy? What can I expect in therapy? &nbsp;What will it be like for my child or teenager to experience counseling? What are the benefits?</p><p>Looking forward to discovering a different way to connect. &nbsp;</p><p> </p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402/563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875/564532a7e4b06c9193d3cb5b/1462548787168/1500w/" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="250" height="209"><media:title type="plain">Can Connecting with Others Through Social Media Really Work?</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Free "Let's Talk" Series via Facebook</title><category>Social Media</category><dc:creator>Joanna Flagler</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2014 19:53:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.concentricchicago.com/blog/2015/11/12/free-lets-talk-series-via-facebook</link><guid isPermaLink="false">560e9363e4b0631d94aeb402:563e1c3de4b055bc3c43d875:5645349fe4b00b19cd50fdd5</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><em>By Jennifer Larson, LCPC, NCC</em></p><p>Please join us for a free "Let's Talk" 3-part series that starts on Tuesday, July 29, 9-10pm CST.
